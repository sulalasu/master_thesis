	abstract = {Blood is a vital product with limited resources, available only from volunteers. For this reason, the blood components to be sent from the blood bank to the transfusion centers (hospitals) should be accurately predicted. There are many variables that affect the demand prediction. In this study, fifteen different qualitative and quantitative variables were determined. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used because the prediction has nonlinear, complex and uncertain relationships and thus it is also difficult to mathematically express on relationship in between input and output variables.  AI methods have the feature of predicting the information that is not given or that may occur in the future by learning the past data.  In the study, AI methods such as Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Learning (DL) were applied to blood bank providing blood supply to public and private hospitals operating in four provinces. The data obtained from the prediction results of AI methods were compared with performance criteria (MAPE, MSE, MAE RMSE and R2) and values of overprediction, underprediction, minimum and maximum deviation. The weekly average over predictions are calculated as 9.69, 5.29, 8.45, and 15.65 and  weekly average underpredictions as 17.57, 3.03, 3.94, and 14.69 for DT, SVM, ANN, and DL methods, respectively. SVM method was determined as giving the best prediction values. Therefore, it is envisaged that the blood component demand prediction can be calculated using the SVM method.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has caused negative impacts on blood supply chain management, due to uncertain supply/demand and logistical disruptions. In the early weeks following the COVID-19 pandemic, 20–30\% reduction in blood donation had observed, which adversely affected the whole blood supply chain. Although this shortage was partially compensated through rescheduling of elective surgeries and shifting some inpatient surgeries to outpatient surgeries, resumption of the normal surgeries by hospitals had increased the demands for the blood products. At the same time, the total blood supply was increased by some measures taken to overcome the blood shortage. In this paper, a multivariate time-series deep learning model based on long short-term memory is proposed to forecast the blood donation/demand. It takes daily time-series of blood donation/demand (internal features) as well as daily time-series of new confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths (external features) as its inputs, and predicts blood donation/demand for the next week. The proposed model is used to achieve a resilient blood inventory management, capable of handling the uncertainties occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed blood donation/demand forecasting model has been successfully simulated on the collected data of Tehran Blood Center in Tehran, Iran, for a time period from February 24, 2020, to October 14, 2021. Obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed model by obtaining 6.1\% and 6.5\% error between the actual and forecasted values of the number of donations and demands, respectively. The results of applying the proposed model for inventory management of blood platelets demonstrate the resiliency of our model to reduce shortage and wastage rates against the existing uncertainty handling models by 32.1\% and 26.6\%, respectively. The proposed method can be used to assist the decision makers in managing the blood supply chains through prioritizing the blood transfusions during COVID-19 and similar pandemics in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
              Planning the future blood collection efforts must be based on adequate forecasts of transfusion demand. In this study, univariate time‐series methods were investigated for their performance in forecasting the monthly demand for RBCs at one tertiary‐care, university hospital.
            
            
              STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
              Three time‐series methods were investigated: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), the Holt‐Winters family of exponential smoothing models, and one neural‐network‐based method. The time series consisted of the monthly demand for RBCs from January 1988 to December 2002 and was divided into two segments: the older one was used to fit or train the models, and the younger to test for the accuracy of predictions. Performance was compared across forecasting methods by calculating goodness‐of‐fit statistics, the percentage of months in which forecast‐based supply would have met the RBC demand (coverage rate), and the outdate rate.
            
            
              RESULTS:
              The RBC transfusion series was best fitted by a seasonal ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)
              12
              model. Over 1‐year time horizons, forecasts generated by ARIMA or exponential smoothing laid within the ± 10 percent interval of the real RBC demand in 79 percent of months (62\% in the case of neural networks). The coverage rate for the three methods was 89, 91, and 86 percent, respectively. Over 2‐year time horizons, exponential smoothing largely outperformed the other methods. Predictions by exponential smoothing laid within the ± 10 percent interval of real values in 75 percent of the 24 forecasted months, and the coverage rate was 87 percent.
            
            
              CONCLUSION:
              Over 1‐year time horizons, predictions of RBC demand generated by ARIMA or exponential smoothing are accurate enough to be of help in the planning of blood collection efforts. For longer time horizons, exponential smoothing outperforms the other forecasting methods.},

              Background
              Blood supply chain management requires estimates about the demand of blood products. The more accurate these estimates are, the less wastage and fewer shortages occur. While the current literature demonstrates tangible benefits from statistical forecasting approaches, it highlights issues that discourage their use in blood supply chain optimization: there is no single approach that works everywhere, and there are no guarantees that any favorable method performance continues into the future.
            
            
              Study Design and Methods
              We design a novel autonomous forecasting system to solve the aforementioned issues. We show how possible changes in blood demand could affect prediction performance using partly synthetic demand data. We use these data then to investigate the performances of different method selection heuristics. Finally, the performances of the heuristics and single method approaches were compared using historical demand data from Finland and the Netherlands. The development code is publicly accessible.
            
            
              Results
              We find that a shift in the demand signal behavior from stochastic to seasonal would affect the relative performances of the methods. Our autonomous system outperforms all examined individual methods when forecasting the synthetic demand series, exhibiting meaningful robustness. When forecasting with real data, the most accurate methods in Finland and in the Netherlands are the autonomous system and the method average, respectively.
            
            
              Discussion
              Optimal use of method selection heuristics, as with our autonomous system, may overcome the need to constantly supervise forecasts in anticipation of changes in demand while being sufficiently accurate in the absence of such changes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Providing fresh blood to keep people in need of blood alive, has always been a main issues of health systems. Right policy-making in this area requires accurate forecasting of blood demand. The current study aimed at predicting demand for different blood groups in Shiraz using Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a hybrid approaches. In the current time series analysis, monthly data of the Shiraz hospitals and medical centers demand for 8 blood groups during 2012–2019 were gathered from Shiraz branch of Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization. ARIMA, ANN and a hybrid model of them was used for prediction. To validate and comprise ARIMA and ANN models, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criteria were used. Finally, ARIMA, ANN and hybrid model estimates were compared to actual data for the last 12 months. R3.6.3 were used for statistical analysis. Based on the MSE and MAE of models, ARIMA had the best prediction for demand of all blood groups except O+ and O−. Moreover, for most blood groups, ARIMA had closer prediction to actual data. The demand for four blood groups (mostly negative groups) was increasing and the demand for other four blood groups (mostly positive ones) was decreasing. All three approaches including ARIMA, ANN and the hybrid of them predicted an almost downward trend for the total blood demand. Differences in the performance of various models could be due to the reasons such as different forecast horizons, daily/month/annual data, different sample sizes, types of demand variables and the transformation applied on them, and finally different blood demand behaviors in communities. Advances in surgical techniques, fetal screening, reduction of accidents leading to heavy bleeding, and the modified pattern of blood request for surgeries appeared to have been effective in reducing the demand trend in the current study. However, a longer time period would certainly provide more accurate estimates.},

	abstract = {Platelet products are both expensive and have very short shelf lives. As usage rates for platelets are highly variable, the effective management of platelet demand and supply is very important yet challenging. The primary goal of this paper is to present an efficient forecasting model for platelet demand at Canadian Blood Services (CBS). To accomplish this goal, five different demand forecasting methods, ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average), Prophet, lasso regression (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), random forest, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are utilized and evaluated via a rolling window method. We use a large clinical dataset for a centralized blood distribution centre for four hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, spanning from 2010 to 2018 and consisting of daily platelet transfusions along with information such as the product specifications, the recipients’ characteristics, and the recipients’ laboratory test results. This study is the first to utilize different methods from statistical time series models to data-driven regression and machine learning techniques for platelet transfusion using clinical predictors and with different amounts of data. We find that the multivariable approaches have the highest accuracy in general, however, if sufficient data are available, a simpler time series approach appears to be sufficient. We also comment on the approach to choose predictors for the multivariable models.},
